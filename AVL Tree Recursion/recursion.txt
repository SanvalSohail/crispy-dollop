The below queries are queries done for the everyOther(List1,List2) predicates.
The goal of this predicate is to tell whether or not List2 is a list of every 
other element from list1.
------------- Q2.1 -------------
--------------------------------
?- everyOther([], []).
Yes (0.00s cpu)
?- everyOther([a], [a]).
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.00s cpu)
?- everyOther([a, b, c, d, e, f], [a, c, e]).
Yes (0.00s cpu)
?- everyOther([a, b, c], [a, c]).
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.00s cpu)
?- everyOther([a, b, c], []).
No (0.00s cpu)
?- everyOther([a, b, c], [a, b]).
No (0.00s cpu)
?- everyOther([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], X).
X = [1, 3, 5, 7]
Yes (0.00s cpu)

The below queries illustrate that the removeDups predicates are working as intented.
As you can see some of the queries respond that there are multiple solutions for a given
query when they should only really have one. I am certain this is not a problem with my code
but has to do with how prolog handles backtracking and presents branch pathing. The solutions for
said queries end up being exactly the same and dont result in differing solutons. You can see proof
of this if you look at "?- removeDups([a, b, c, b, d, b, c, a], [d, b, c, a])." and 
"?- removeDups([a, b, c, b, d, b, c, a], X).", these queries illustrate what I mentioned about
the answers being the same even though it shows multiple solutions.
------------- Q2.2 -------------
--------------------------------
?- removeDups([a], [a]).
Yes (0.00s cpu)
?- removeDups([a, b, c], [a, b, c]).
Yes (0.00s cpu)
?- removeDups([a, b, c, d], [a, b, c, d]).
Yes (0.00s cpu)
?- removeDups([d, a, b, c, d], [a, b, c, d]).
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.05s cpu)
?- removeDups([d, a, b, c, d], [d, a, b, c]).
No (0.00s cpu)
?- removeDups([a, b, c, b, d, b, c, a], [d, b, c, a]).
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
Yes (0.03s cpu, solution 2, maybe more)
No (0.03s cpu)
?- removeDups([a, b, c, b, d, b, c, a], X).
X = [d, b, c, a]
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
X = [d, b, c, a]
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 2, maybe more)
No (0.00s cpu)
?- removeDups([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1], X).
X = [4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1]
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.02s cpu)

Queries for sameFirstLast. I was initially using the last predicate
which is a standard predicate for prolog but did not know if it was allowed
so I didnt end up using it and instead used just lists and recursion.
I recursively deleted elements from the list until it called my base case
which is there are only two elements left in the list which are the same.
------------- Q2.3 -------------
--------------------------------
?- sameFirstLast([[a], z, b, c, d, [a]]).
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.00s cpu)
?- sameFirstLast([21, 22, [k, l, m], 21]).
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.00s cpu)
?- sameFirstLast([a, b, [a, b]]).
No (0.00s cpu)
?- sameFirstLast([a, [c, [d]], b]).
No (0.00s cpu)
?- sameFirstLast([1, X1, X2, X3, X4, 1]).
X1 = X1
X2 = X2
X3 = X3
X4 = X4
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.02s cpu)
